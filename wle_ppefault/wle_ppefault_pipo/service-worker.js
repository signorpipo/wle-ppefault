// #endregion Service Worker Setup



// #region Known Issues
//
// - #IGNORE_URL_PARAMS_ISSUE
//   From my tests, it seems that the current APIs to fetch from the cache ignoring the URL params does not fetch the most recently cached resource
//   This is an issue since there is no way to actually get the most recent one if u want to ignore the URL params, and most often than not it will
//   just return the cached resource for the first URL that has been cached (with the same resource URL excluding the URL params that is)
//   This is why, for now, the ignore URL params feature can only be used as a fallback, otherwise, used as the first way to fetch from cache, it would be too
//   unpredictable, since it does not either give u the exact match nor the most updated, but basically a random one
//
//   A possible solution would be to create a feature to delete the resource from the cache ignoring URL params before putting it in the cache
//   This would basically only store the last fetched resource, not keeping every other one whith the same base URL but different URL params
//   The issue with this solution is that u will never be able to cache every different resource based on the specific URL params, but at least u will
//   always fetch the most updated one
//
// - #IGNORE_VARY_HEADER_ISSUE
//   It is exactly the same issue as #IGNORE_URL_PARAMS_ISSUE, just for vary header instead of URL params
//
// - #APP_UPDATE_CAN_LEAD_TO_MIXED_VERSION_ISSUE
//   If a service worker only partially manage to cache the data(both during precache or normal fetch phase),
//   and u update both your app and the service worker (to clean the current cache and build a new one),
//   while the new service worker install itself the current service worker might start to use the new data while serving
//   some of the current cached one too, mixing the 2 versions
//   As soon as the new service worker is activated the app will be fixed, so it's not permanent, but in the meantime u could have errors
//   in your app due to this
//   You should not worry too much about this tho, since it should not be an issue happening often, especially if you are not
//   updating your app every other day, and also eventually fix itself
//
//   The easiest way to avoid having this, if u are really worried about it, is to have an empty @_myResourceURLsToPrecache list,
//   so to complete the install as fast as possible, and enable @_myImmediatelyActivateNewServiceWorker and @_myReloadAllPagesOnServiceWorkerActivation
//   This will basically switch to the new service worker as soon as possible, therefore fetching the new version of your app
//
//   If u instead care about precaching, an idea would be to find out that a new service worker is trying to install inside your app code,
//   and "block" your app (possibly displaying a banner saying that the new version is been downloaded) until the installation has been completed
//   U should also enable @_myImmediatelyActivateNewServiceWorker and @_myReloadAllPagesOnServiceWorkerActivation
//   I honestly think this would be an overkill unless it's really important, for example for a multiplayer experience where a glitch could give an advantage
//
//   // This should be done before window.navigator.serviceWorker.register
//   window.navigator.serviceWorker?.getRegistration().then(function (registration) {
//      if(registration != null) {
//          registration.addEventListener("updatefound", function () {
//              // Block your app, when the new service worker will finish install the controller change event
//              // will then make your page reload
//              // Check @_myImmediatelyActivateNewServiceWorker to see how u can reload the page on controller change
//          });
//      }
//   });
//
//   Another solution, if u want to precache, is to unregister the current service worker when a new one is trying to install and reload the page
//   The main difference here is that u don't have to wait for the new service worker to complete, since, by unregistering the current service worker,
//   on reload u will get the new data immediately, while the new service worker is installing
//
//   // This should be done before window.navigator.serviceWorker.register
//   // I'm not 100% sure about the behavior of the unregister function, so use this with caution, even though it seems to work
//   window.navigator.serviceWorker?.getRegistration().then(function (registration) {
//      if(registration != null) {
//          registration.addEventListener("updatefound", function () {
//              registration.unregister().then(function () {
//                  window.location.reload();
//              });
//          });
//      }
//   });
//
//   Yet another solution would be to disable @_myRecoverInstallationFromLastAttempt (or at least disable @_myInstallationTemporaryDataSharingEnabled),
//   and enable @_myRejectServiceWorkerOnPrecacheFailResourceURLsToInclude on every resource, then disable @_myFetchFromCacheAllowedResourceURLsToInclude for every resource
//   that has been precached, so that there is no way they will be fetched again, and, as last, enable @_myRejectServiceWorkerOnActivationFail, so that only when
//   even the activation phase is properly completed the service worker can actually start
//   This will make it so that, only when all the precached resources have been precached during the same session, the service worker is activated
//   If all the cachable resources (or at least the core ones) are in the precache list, and the fetch from network is disabled for those resources,
//   then your app will not be updated until a new service worker is activated
//   This will make your app basically feel like an offline app that needs to be installed more than a web page, even though, if the service worker fails
//   your app will still be able to run by fetching from the network, but of course every resource will be the latest one in that case
//
//   As last, if u want to make your app work only when controlled by a service worker, u can check that
//   window.navigator.serviceWorker?.controller != null, and display a dialog saying your app is installing otherwise, preventing your
//   app from being used in the meantime
//   U will also have to enable @_myImmediatelyTakeControlOfAllPages, and either enable @_myReloadAllPagesAfterImmediatelyTakingControlOfThem,
//   or reload on controller change yourself (check @_myImmediatelyActivateNewServiceWorker to see how u can reload the page on controller change)
//   Since the installation might fail, u should also check every X seconds if the registration does actually contain a controller,
//   and display that the installation failed otherwise
//
//   let serviceWorkerInstallResults = { installing: false, installFailed: window.navigator.serviceWorker == null };
//
//   window.navigator.serviceWorker?.register("service-worker.js").then(function () {
//       serviceWorkerInstallResults.installing = true;
//   }).catch(function () {
//       serviceWorkerInstallResults.installFailed = true;
//   });
//
//   ...
//
//   // Every X seconds perform these checks
//
//   window.navigator.serviceWorker?.getRegistration().then(function (registration) {
//       if (serviceWorkerInstallResults.installing) {
//           if (registration != null) {
//               serviceWorkerInstallResults.installFailed = true;
//           }
//       }
//   });
//
//   if (serviceWorkerInstallResults.installFailed) {
//       // Display a dialog saying the installation failed and reload or whatever u prefer
//   } else if (window.navigator.serviceWorker?.controller == null) {
//       // Display a dialog saying the installation is in progress
//   } else {
//       // Display a dialog saying the app has been installed and reload the page or whatever u prefer
//   }
//
//   As always, this is just an example to give u an idea on how to achieve that, and u might have to adjust this to your needs
//   
//   A thing to note is that u might think that if u always fetch first from the network, or update the cache in background,
//   u should not have this issue, but this is not correct
//   For example, even if u always fetch from network first and u might manage to fetch new resources,
//   u might also fail to fetch some of them (due to network issue for example), fallbacking to the cache,
//   resulting in a mix of old and new resources
//   This means that, if u want to be sure to not have this issue, even when u are using these kinds of setups u have to use one of the above solutions,
//   or another one that better fits your needs
//
//   I'm also not sure if the browser own cache can also mess up with this and serve an older resource when fetching it from network
//   I don't know how u could handle this case or if it is even something to worry about, but the issue here is that even when installing a new service worker
//   and precaching the new resources, if a resource is fetched from the browser cache the service worker will think it's the latest one, even though it's not,
//   leading to a mix of old and new resources
//   It seems like the service worker fetch actually bypass the browser cache, so it should not be an issue, but I'm not 100% sure about it
//   Beside, I don't know if there could also be other things intercepting your network request, like the service hosting your app,
//   which could use their own cache to serve you the resources u are trying to fetch
//   I'm not sure if this is even possible, but if it was, this would mean that, even if the service worker can actually 
//   bypass the browser cache, something else might give u a cached resource anyway
//
//   As u can see, this is a complex issue, so if for u this is really important I advise u to also do your own research on this topic,
//   and use this more as a starting point than an actual complete solution to your problem
